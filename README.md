# Flycatcher_Spermatogenesis
This repository contains files and code of the publication: "Single-Cell Transcriptomics reveals relaxed evolutionary constraint during meiosis and spermiogenesis in two passerine birds"

The two markdown files are the ones needed to reproduce the downstream analysis after processing with cellranger and velocyto. The code is written to use the samples of the Dataset number 2. However the pipeline is exactly the same for processing DS1. 

Clustering_2022_DS2_finalcode.Rmd is the file to start with. 

The .loom and .rds files are too big to be posted here but will be made available upon request, just send an email to: carolina.segami@duke.edu. All other files needed are provided here.
